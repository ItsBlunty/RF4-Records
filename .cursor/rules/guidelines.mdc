 - The Goal for this project is to deploy on railway, since we're using selenium already, we will use browserless v1 and refer to those docs instead of v2.
 - This project requires scraping javascript so we must use browser emulation, and selenium works locally, so we are using that ONLY. No manual scrapes or fallbacks.
 - Dont forget to chmod for vite in the build phase
 - This project has 10 regions and 5 categories. Always be sure that you include all these in changes to the scraping.
 - We always need to handle these weight types on scraping "9.747 kg" "341 g" "1 079.839 kg".
 - Once changes are made, test them as possible, but remember that you're on windows and using powershell, and the goal is for a railway deploy, so it may not totally work locally.
 - Once tested, commit and push changes unless the user asks specifically not to.
 - Use proper powershell syntax
